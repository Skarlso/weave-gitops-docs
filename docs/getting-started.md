# Getting Started

Let's get an app deployed with **Weave Gitops** in less than 5 minutes.

**This is Work In Progress**

## Pre-requisites

1. A running cluster (e.g. [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/))
2. A Github account 
3. A workload that you would like to deploy (or you can use the sample workload)

## Installation (needs work!)

1. Download the binary, untar and move to the path (TBD)
2. Create a new keypair and add the public key to the userâ€™s GitHub repository
3. Create an application repository in GitHub under an organization account that includes the user, and populate it with a workload to deploy
4. Clone the application repository locally
5. Install Weave GitOps

    `wego install | kubectl apply -f -`

    (note: this will change shortly)

6. Wait for controllers to come online

    `kubectl get all -A`
7. Change to the directory containing the local clone of the GitHub application repository

    `wego add --private-key=<created private key file> .`
8. Wait for the workload to show up in the cluster
